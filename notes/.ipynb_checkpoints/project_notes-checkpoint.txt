GLITCH OMICRON PROJECT CURRENT GOALS:

1: keep searching summary pages for glitchy days and hours, make csv tables with get_omicron script for these segments.
2: classify using PCA (or other) on these tables based solely on the omicron triggers ( 2 or 3 parameters)
3: Also, create qscans of the glitches of each csv file (short 1 to 2 seconds around each glitch)
4: Classify the images of the qscans using PCA (or other)
